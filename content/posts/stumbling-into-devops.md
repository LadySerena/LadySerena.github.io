I've told this story so many times, but I haven't actually wrote it down. So here it is for those curious.

So a long time ago I wanted to be computer hardware designer which is kind of wild considering I actively run away 
from hardware now. The impetus was a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTyGFM1M3zs) that was some 
promo thing from GlobalFoundries, but it was so cool to think that sand (and other stuff like boron and 
phosphorus) could be something that powers well everything from my phone to the servers at GCP. 

So I start studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, and start learning that maybe I wasn't in 
the right program. I was passable at the physics and chemistry, but I was happiest in my embedded systems courses. I 
was in my sophomore year, so it wasn't a big deal to pivot more towards embedded systems (think the systems that 
make up your car for example). I was decent slinging C for assignments and divining how to interface with various 
integrated circuits.  

I was a happy-go-lucky person who started pondering how to get a job, and the typical career trajectory was going to 
school, getting an internship, and finally a full time job. Life had other plans for me since it was really hard to 
break into the industry, and most places that were hiring were medical device companies. Now for those who don't 
know me in person, I get really queasy around anything related to medicine (hence why I'd be a terrible doctor). 
Fortunately a decent amount of my classmates were doing software development, so I moved in that direction. 

When it was time to get back on the internship hunt in the spring (fyi for students I've learned that fall is when 
the bulk of the recruiting takes place). I had a terrible hit rate with interviews, but a local company gave me a 
shot at information security. The internship showed me a couple of things. One, working was better for me than 
school (getting paid was kinda rad not gonna lie). Two, security was an interesting subject area, but it wouldn't be 
my permanent place.
